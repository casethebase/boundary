  The anatomy of a Boundary alias

# Aliases

An alias is a resource that lets you associate a string with a specific target.
The string must be a globally unique value which follows DNS naming constraints.
You can use the alias instead of the target ID when you run a command, and Boundary automatically substitutes the target resource that the alias references.

## Attributes

All alias types have the following attributes:

- `value` - Indicates the name of the alias string that represents a resource in Boundary.
The value must be globally unique.
- `destination_id` (optional) - Indicates a valid target ID in the same scope or child scope as the alias is in.
- `scope_id` - Indicates the scope the alias resides in.
At this time, aliases are only supported in the global scope.
