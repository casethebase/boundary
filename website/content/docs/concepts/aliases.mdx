# Aliases

An alias is a resource that lets you associate a string with a specific target.
The string must be a globally unique value which follows DNS naming constraints.
You can use the alias instead of the target ID when you run a command, and Boundary automatically substitutes the target resource that the alias references.

## Background

When you create a resource in Boundary, it assigns the resource a randomly generated identifier.
You must use those IDs to perform actions in Boundary.

For example, when you connect to a target using the Clipboard, you must reference the target ID by typing `boundary ssh connect -target-id tccp_123456789`.
Since it can be difficult to remember the unique IDs, users frequently have to look up the identifiers for any resources they want to operate on.

Aliases simplify this process.
When you create an alias and associate it with a target, you can later use the alias instead of the target ID in commands.
Boundary automatically resolves to the resource that the alias references.

## Naming conventions

Aliases must comply with DNS naming rules.
The alias `value` parameter must meet the following criteria:

- At least one label must be joined together by a period ( . )
- Consists of alphanumeric characters A - Z, 0 - 9, and hyphens ( - )
- Not case sensitive
- Cannot start or end with a hyphen ( - )
- Between 1 and 63 characters long
- The final label cannot be all numeric characters

## Scopes

At this time, you can only create aliases in the `global` scope.
An alias' destination target can be in any scope, however.
If you delete a project, Boundary clears the `destination_id` parameter for any aliases that resolve to targets in that project, so that they no longer function.

## Permissions

The existence of an alias for a Boundary resource does not change how permissions function.
Anyone can attempt to use an alias to access a target, but if you do not have permission to access the target, the attempt fails.
You can create an alias for a target, even if you do not have permssion to access the target.

Separating the permissions from aliases and destination resources means a different set of people can manage the aliases than the people who have permission to operate on targets.
For example, you may have a project with a sensitive set of targets.
You can configure Boundary to allow a select few users to manage those targets, while a different group of users manage the aliases.
